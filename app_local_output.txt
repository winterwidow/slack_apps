 Summary:
 A neural network is a machine learning model that mimics the human brain's decision-making process using artificial neurons. It consists of layers of nodes connected with weights and thresholds, relying on training data to improve accuracy. Neural networks are powerful tools in computer science and AI, enabling tasks like speech and image recognition. Each node functions as a linear regression model with input data, weights, bias, and an activation function. The network passes data through layers in a feedforward manner. An example calculation demonstrates how a neural network node makes a decision based on inputs, weights, and a threshold value.
